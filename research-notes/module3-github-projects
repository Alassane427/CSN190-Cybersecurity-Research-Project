## Topic 1: Social Engineering
### Project 1
-	Citation: TrustedSec. (2025). Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET). GitHub. https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit
- Type: Security Tool
-	What it does: SET is a program hackers and security testers use to practice social engineering attacks. It can send fake emails, set up fake websites, or trick users into giving passwords. Security teams use it in labs to show how real attackers work. Needs Python and runs best on Linux.
-	Link: https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit
-	Relevance: 5/5 – Very useful for showing real examples of how social engineering attacks are done.
### Project 2
-	Citation: Gophish. (2025). Gophish: Phishing Toolkit. GitHub. https://github.com/gophish/gophish
-	Type: Security Training Tool
-	What it does: Gophish is a tool to send fake phishing emails safely. Companies use it to test employees and teach them to spot scams. It shows who clicked on links or gave away info. It is easy to set up but only works for email-based attacks, not all types of social engineering.
-	Link: https://github.com/gophish/gophish
-	Relevance: 4/5 – Best for phishing research and training, though limited to emails.





## Topic 2: Secure Code Review
### Project 1
-	Citation: r2c. (2025). Semgrep. GitHub. https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep
-	Type: Code Scanning Tool
-	What it does: Semgrep scans code and looks for mistakes or unsafe patterns. It supports many languages like Python, Java, C, etc. You can use rules other people made or write your own. It’s fast and works in text editors or CI pipelines. Sometimes it gives false alarms.
-	Link: https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep
-	Relevance: 5/5 – One of the best open-source tools for learning how to check code for security problems.
### Project 2
-	Citation: Bearer. (2025). Bearer CLI. GitHub. https://github.com/Bearer/bearer
-	Type: Security Scanner
-	What it does: Bearer looks at how data moves through code and warns if sensitive info (like passwords or personal data) is handled unsafely. It focuses on real privacy and security risks, not just simple coding errors. Works on several languages.
-	Link: https://github.com/Bearer/bearer
-	Relevance: 4/5 – Great for learning about how unsafe code can leak sensitive data.
