For my research on Social Engineering, I don’t need any special tools other than the internet. Most of my information will come from online articles, news stories, and real examples. I would rate myself as level two because I know what social engineering is but can’t explain it well yet. I want to learn more about how these attacks work and how companies protect themselves from them. Since there are so many free resources online, I believe this topic will be easy to research and complete within the time given. This topic will help me understand how hackers use people instead of computers to get information. It will also help me get better at doing research and explaining things in simple words so anyone can understand. The hardest part will be learning enough to clearly teach others how to protect themselves. This connects with my goal to work in cybersecurity because understanding human-based attacks is very important. I’m excited about this topic because I like the idea of teaching others how to stay safe online. My main goal is to create a small awareness guide or presentation that helps people recognize social engineering attacks. My realistic goal is to write a short paper that explains the main types of attacks, gives examples, and shows ways to prevent them. The minimum goal I want to reach is finishing a report that shows I understand how these attacks work and how people can protect themselves.
For my research on Secure Code Review, I will need to learn some basic programming and understand common security mistakes that can happen in code. I would rate myself at level two because I don’t know much about coding yet. I plan to use websites like OWASP, GitHub, and other online tutorials to learn. I don’t have any code samples now, but I can use free open-source projects as examples. Since there are many free resources online, I think I can complete this project during the semester. This topic will help me build technical skills, like spotting security problems in code and learning how to fix them. It will also help me understand how developers write safer programs. The hardest part will be reading and understanding the code, but it connects well with my career goal in cybersecurity. I’m interested in this topic because I want to learn how small mistakes in code can lead to big security issues and how to prevent them. My main goal is to look at several open-source projects and share ways to make their code safer. My realistic goal is to review one project, find a few common problems, and explain how to fix them. My minimum goal is to learn about basic secure coding rules and show a few examples that prove I understand how code reviews help stop attacks




Criteria	
Topic 1: Social Engineering (1–5)	Topic 2: Secure Code Review (1–5)
Feasibility / Accessibility	SOE = 5 	SCR = 3 
Personal Interest SOE =	5 	SCR = 4 
Learning Potential SOE =	4 	SCR = 5 
Career Relevance	SOE = 5 	SCR = 5 
TOTAL SOE =	19 / 20	 SCR = 17 / 20



I chose Secure Code Review as my final topic. For this project, I want to learn how to find and stop security problems in code. My goal is to understand how developers can write safer programs and how small mistakes in code can lead to big security issues. I plan to look at open-source projects and use online tools or websites to see how security testing works. My research will include examples of common problems like SQL injections or cross-site scripting and how developers can fix them.
This topic is a little hard but still realistic. It’s hard because I’m still learning how to code and how to read programs, but it’s possible because there are many free guides, tools, and examples online. Websites like OWASP and GitHub will help me learn more and practice what I find. This topic connects to my career goal in cybersecurity because checking code for security problems is an important skill for security analysts. It will also help me understand how software security works behind the scenes. My ambitious goal is to review a few open-source projects and suggest ways to make their code safer. My realistic target is to study one small project, find a few common problems, and explain how they can be fixed. Lastly my minimum goal learn the main safe coding practices and show one or two examples that prove I understand how code reviews help prevent attacks. This topic has a lot of learning value because it will teach me how to think like both a developer and a security professional. Even if I don’t become great at coding right away, I’ll still learn how software vulnerabilities work and how to reduce them. These skills will help me in the future when I work in cybersecurity and need to spot risks or protect systems.
