# CSN190-Cybersecurity-Research-Project

My name is Alassane Camara and I am taking CSN190 a course which is going to help launch my Cybersecurity career in the right directions. Giving me the guidance and tools I need in succeeding in this field.

Cybersecurity interests me because I was once a victim of identity theft. That experience opened my eyes to how real and damaging it can be, and it motivated me to learn how to protect myself and others from cybercriminals.
